## About

This project provides interactive visualizations based on the research paper [arXiv:2512.04047](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04047) by Nadav Kunievsky (Knowledge Lab, UChicago).

The paper examines how advancing AI persuasion technology fundamentally changes elite strategy in democracies. Rather than polarization emerging organically, it becomes a **deliberate governance tool** when persuasion costs drop significantly.

## Features

### Opinion Distribution Simulator
- Real-time visualization of population opinion dynamics
- Single Elite and Competing Elites modes
- Adjustable AI technology parameters (persuasion cost, reach, intensity)
- Population resistance and size controls
- Polarization index tracking over time

### Template Scenarios
8 pre-configured experiments demonstrating key findings:

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Authoritarian AI Takeover | Dystopian cheap AI manipulation |
| Gentle Nudge Democracy | Current social media influence levels |
| Rapid Radicalization | Targeted manipulation of susceptible groups |
| Resistant Population | Educated population limits persuasion |
| Two-Party Polarization War | Equal elites create bimodal distribution |
| Unstable Democracy | Frequent power changes create chaos |
| Entrenched Political Camps | Semi-lock tribal regions form |
| Balanced Competition | Healthy democracy with slow polarization |

### Visual Paper Summary
Comprehensive infographic breakdown covering:
- Model skeleton and formal setup
- Polarization pull mechanism
- Semi-lock regions in competing elites
- Key concept glossary

## Key Concepts

- **Persuasion Cost**: As AI advances, manipulation costs drop dramatically
- **Polarization Pull**: Single elite optimal strategy pushes toward extremes
- **Semi-Lock Regions**: Competing elites create resistant supporter bases
- **Power Transitions**: Regime stability affects polarization dynamics
- **Strategic Targeting**: Elites focus on persuadable center-leaning individuals
